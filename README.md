# Square Mobile Payments SDK

Build remarkable in-person experiences using Square's Mobile Payments SDK product now in beta. The Mobile Payments SDK has the advantage of being an API driven framework that allows for full customization as well as using the latest [V2/Payments](https://developer.squareup.com/explorer/square/payments-api/list-payments) API.

To install the `SquareMobilePaymentsSDK` into your Xcode project, follow these steps:

1. Select `File > Add Package Dependencies...`.

# This feature is only available when provided a sandbox application id.
